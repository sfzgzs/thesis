    \begin{ntheorem}[\WhileCC-approximability Theorem](1)
        All elementary functions are \WhileCC-approximable.

        This is the easiest part, yet occupies about 30 pages of my master's thesis \ldots \smiley{}

    \note[itemize]{Talking about the challenges, the \WhileCC-approximability theorem is actually super long. It's done by induction over the structure of elementary functions. There are a few interesting challenges we faced when doing the inductive proof.}
