\begin{frame}{Problem}
    \begin{itemize}
        \pause \item Four models of computation for \textit{partial} functions on $\Reals$ are equivalent when assuming \textcolor{violet}{acceptability} of functions. 
        \pause \item How large is this class of acceptable functions?
    \end{itemize}
\pause \textbf{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Solution}}\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \pause \item Show that the elementary functions satisfy the acceptability conditions. 
        % \pause Elementary functions are built up from \pause the variable $x$ \pause and constants for computable reals, \pause by applying (repeatedly) \pause the four fields operations,\pause $n$-th roots,\pause the exponential and trigonometric functions and their inverses.
        % \pause \item Compute the elementary functions  in one model (\WhileCC-approximability). 
        % \pause\item Prove that the elementary functions are \textcolor{violet}{acceptable} (and hence computable in all four).
    \end{itemize}
