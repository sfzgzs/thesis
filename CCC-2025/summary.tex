\begin{frame}{Summary}
    We proved that:
    \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item all elementary functions are \WhileCC-approximable.
        \pause \item all elementary functions are acceptable
        \pause and hence computable in the other three models as well.
    \end{itemize}
     \pause We also 
    \begin{itemize}
         \item  presented an \textbf{alternative characterization} of acceptable functions \pause using the \textbf{local continuity witness} concept, and
         \item found a few useful tricks along the way for implementing approximations of piecewise functions.
    \end{itemize}
